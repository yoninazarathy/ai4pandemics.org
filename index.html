            Welcome to <b>AI4PAN</b>, The Artificial Intelligence for Pandemics group centered at 
            The University of Queensland (<a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/">UQ</a>). 
            The group's focus is the application of data science, machine learning, statistical learning, 
            applied mathematics, computation, and other "artificial intelligence" techniques for managing 
            pandemics both at the epidemic and clinical level. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Our fortnightly <b>AI4PAN Seminar</b> run via Zoom at 10am on Wednesdays (AEST = Brisbane time zone) and monthly from 
            June 8th, 2022. 
            Organized by

                 Since the initial outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, over 215 million subsequent cases 
                 have been recorded. The causative agent, Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly transmissible 
                 and characterized by a heterogenous respiratory disease that ranges from mild symptoms to acute respiratory distress 
                 syndrome and death. Over 4.5 million deaths have been recorded to date.  
                 Direct detection of viral RNA via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a highly sensitive and specific 
                 diagnostic tool for SARS-CoV-2 and the current gold standard for testing. However, whilst highly sensitive, a certain 
                 threshold of viral RNA must be present for subsequent amplification and detection by qPCR. Accordingly, it is possible
                 for a close contact of a SARS-CoV-2 positive individual to initially test negative for the virus but then later in the 
                 incubation period, when there is increased viral replication, to test positive. As a result, current public health 
                 guidelines in Australia require close contacts of a SARS-CoV-2 positive case, as well as passengers from overseas, to 
                 quarantine for the entirety of the viral incubation period (14 days). The time taken for an infected individual to be 
                 identified by qPCR also has implications for anti-viral therapeutics. Current monoclonal antibody therapeutics are most 
                 efficacious if given early in infection. Thus, the importance of identifying SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals as early 
                 as possible early in infection is appreciable. Here, we hypothesise that there is a gene signature in the nasopharynx 
                 that can be detected in SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals prior to the detection of viral RNA using qPCR. To test this 
                 hypothesis we will use a combination of clinical samples and unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to 
                 potentially develop a new, early diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
