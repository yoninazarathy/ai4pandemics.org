            Welcome to <b>AI4PAN</b>, The Artificial Intelligence for Pandemics group centered at The University of Queensland (<a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/">UQ</a>). The group's focus is the application of data science, machine learning, statistical learning, applied mathematics, computation, and other "artificial intelligence" techniques for managing pandemics both at the epidemic and clinical level. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Our fortnightly <b>AI4PAN Seminar</b> runs via Zoom at 10am on Wednesdays (AEST = Brisbane time zone) and is organized by <a href="https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/3468/roxanne-jemison">Roxanne Jemison</a>, <a href ="https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/5332/hamid-khataee">Hamid Khateee</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/aminathshausan">Aminath Shausan</a>.
